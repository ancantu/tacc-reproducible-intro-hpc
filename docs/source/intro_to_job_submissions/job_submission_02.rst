Interactive Sessions with idev
==============================

The ``idev`` utility initiates an interactive session on a compute node so that you can issue commands and run code as if you were doing so on your personal machine. An interactive session is recommended for when you want to quickly compile, run, and validate code. Accessing a single compute node is accomplished by simply executing ``idev`` on any of the TACC systems.

Initiating an Interactive Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash
   
   login1$ idev   

You will see output that includes the following excerpts:

.. code-block:: bash

   -> After your idev job begins to run, a command prompt will appear,
   -> and you can begin your interactive development session. 
   -> We will report the job status every 4 seconds: (PD=pending, R=running).
